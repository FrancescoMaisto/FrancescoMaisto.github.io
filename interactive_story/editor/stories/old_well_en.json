I was the daughter of the Marquis of Ravenclaw — a man of formidable power and conflicted heart, who was bound by the chains of duty to maintain his honor. Conceived in a forbidden liaison with his young housemaid, Agnes, my mother. My very existence was a scandal, for I was the living reminder of his adultery. Even as I took my first breath, it was clear that I was to be discarded as a symbol of his betrayal. In that dark, fateful moment, I sensed that my destiny would be determined by the nature of his soul — a soul that was unmistakably {keyword}.",
