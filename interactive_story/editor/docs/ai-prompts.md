## Zoom Feature
I would like to implement one more feature: zooming the flowchar in and out using Ctrl + mouse wheel. 
Here are some specifications:

- When the user press the Ctrl key and spins the mouse wheel up, the whole flowchart is zoomed-in in 20% increments up to a maximum magnification of 300%.
- When the user press the Ctrl key and spins the mouse wheel down, the whole flowchart is zoomed-out in 20% increments down to a minium magnification of 40%.
- Add a text field reading "Zoom: X%", where X is the magnification factor, to the bottom left corner of the screen to let the user know what's the current magnification level. This text field should use the Roboto Condensed font.

## Snapping

Please make it so that, when the user is dragging a single block, that block snaps when it's aligned horizontally or vertically with another block.
