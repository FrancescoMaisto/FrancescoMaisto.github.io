Alphattack is a single-player typing game in which the player needs to defend a city from increasingly longer waves of falling bombs and other enemies. Each bomb and enemy has a letter or number "printed" on it; in order to destroy them the player needs to hit the corresponding letter/number on the computer keyboard. City buildings are gradually destroyed when hit by a bomb and act as a shield to the city's ground. If a bomb eventually hits the city's ground, the city is destroyed and the player loses a life.
