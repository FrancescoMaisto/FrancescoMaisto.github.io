I was the daughter of the Marquis of Ravenclaw — a man of formidable power and conflicted heart, who was bound by the chains of duty to maintain his honor. Conceived in a forbidden liaison with his young housemaid, Agnes, my mother. My very existence was a scandal, for I was the living reminder of his adultery. Even as I took my first breath, it was clear that I was to be discarded as a symbol of his betrayal. In that dark, fateful moment, I sensed that my destiny would be determined by the nature of his soul — a soul that was unmistakably ███████.",

His words were as sharp as the winter wind, leaving no space for compassion. That grim command was given to a loyal servant, whose eyes betrayed his inner conflict even as he prepared to carry out his dire duty — to dispose of me by throwing me into the old manor's well. I remember the moment he drew near — his face set in a ███████ mask that hinted at the true nature of his intentions.",
